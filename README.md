Reports real-time pollutant levels in your city

## About
Get real-time air quality data for more than 1000 cities from the World Air Quality Index project. By default, mycroft reports real-time pm 2.5 concentration levels from a monitoring station closest to you.

You can also ask mycroft for pm 10, o3 (ozone), no2 (nitrogen dioxide), and so2 (sulphur dioxide) levels at your location or in other cities.

All pollutant levels are reported for the previous hour and are measured in micrograms per cubic meter.

## Examples
* "How is the air quality"
* "What is the sulphur dioxide level in hong kong"
* "How's the air quality in manila"
* "What's the p m 2.5 level in new delhi"
