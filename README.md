Reports real-time pollutant levels in your city

## About
Get real-time air quality data for more than 1000 cities from 
the [World Air Quality Index](https://aqicn.org/) project. 

By default, Mycroft reports **real-time** (most recent, 
1-hour average) PM 2.5 (fine particulate matter) concentration 
levels at a monitoring station in your city. You can also ask 
Mycroft for PM 10 (coarse particulate matter), CO (carbon 
monoxode), O<sub>3</sub> (ozone), NO<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen 
dioxide), and SO<sub>2</sub> (sulphur dioxide) levels at your 
location or in other cities. Mycroft will also report how long 
back the reading was taken if the measurements were made more 
than two hour ago, and a health cautionary statement (only for 
PM 2.5 concentration levels). All pollutant levels are measured 
in micrograms per cubic meter.

The Air Quality skill requires an API key to access data from 
the World Air Quality Index project. For instructions to obtain 
a key, visit the skill settings in your Mycroft account. 
Terms of acceptable data and API usage apply.  

## Examples
* "What is the air quality?"
* "How polluted is the air in Singapore?"
* "What is the sulphur dioxide level in Hong Kong?"
* "What's the ozone level in Dublin?"
* "What's the coarse particulate matter level in New Delhi?"
