Reports real-time pollutant levels in your city

## About
Get real-time air quality data for more than 1000 cities from the [World Air Quality Index](https://aqicn.org/) project. 

By default, Mycroft reports *real-time* PM 2.5 concentration levels at a monitoring station in your city.

You can also ask Mycroft for PM 10, O<sub>3</sub> (ozone), NO<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen dioxide), and SO<sub>2</sub> (sulphur dioxide) levels at your location or in other cities.

Mycroft will also report the time of the reading. All pollutant levels are measured in micrograms per cubic meter.

## Examples
* "What is the air quality?"
* "How polluted is the air in Singapore?"
* "What is the sulphur dioxide level in Hong Kong?"
* "How's the air quality in Dublin?"
* "What's the P M 2.5 level in New Delhi?"
